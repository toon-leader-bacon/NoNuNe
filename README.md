# NoNuNe
A neural net library created by your's truly: Nocab Software. 

If you only have a few seconds check out the Perceptron.cs file. This is where I’ve spent the bulk of my time recently. 

 - All of the backpropagation logic has been migrated into a dedicated utility class called the `MomentumOptimizer`. 

- At the bottom of the Perceptron file there is serialization code in the `#region JsonConvertable`

For a more in depth look, consider the Layer.cs and Network.cs files which are the container objects for allowing the construction of a full neural net. 

Finally, to see this code in action consider the Program.cs file.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, feel free to message me directly at ArthurBacon@NocabSoftware.com

I’m always excited to talk about my personal projects so I would love to hear your opinion!
